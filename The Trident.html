        <p class="text-small">The trick to having good wholesome meal with wide variety is to opt for an all-day dining restaurant, which never fails to disappoint you in terms of diversity and service. One of the key pleasures of dining at an all-day dining restaurant is the timings, which are flexible enough to allow you to drive down anytime of the day or night to feast on a lavish meal. Many restaurants even do a midnight buffet that draws the patrons in hordes, especially the nocturnal party-hoppers who end up feeling peckish after a long lively party. One of the most popular and scenic all-day restaurants in Mumbai is ‘Frangipani’, located at the famous Nariman Point under glamourous Trident Hotel.</p>
