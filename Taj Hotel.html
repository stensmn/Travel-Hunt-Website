        <p class="text-big"> The Table</p>
        <p class="text-small">The Table, one of India’s most celebrated restaurants, has welcomed guests to enjoy its globally inspired cuisine and hospitality since opening in 2011. Located in the iconic Colaba area of Mumbai, The Table has been a trailblazer within the national restaurant community. From introducing the concept of small and large plates to providing a true farm to table experience with produce from its own farm, The Table continues to be at the forefront of Indian hospitality. With an ingredient-driven focus, global accents and nuances, the menu is a commitment to simplicity and purity of flavour, a philosophy inherited from San Francisco.</p>

        <p class="text-big"> Olympia Coffee House</p>
        <p class="text-small">There is half a chance that everyone who lives in Mumbai would have visited this place in the heart of Colaba, South Mumbai, at least once with friends, and devoured a mutton fry masala or a bheja fry with naan. After all, not too many restaurants in the city are 100 years old.</p>

        <p class="text-big"> Miss T</p>
        <p class="text-small"> When the crew behind The Table and Woodside Inn join forces to create a new restaurant you know it is going to be special. Miss T ( which is in the same place where Busaba and Lemon Leaf once were ) is a labour of love that is a much-needed addition to the neighbourhood. They have also managed to rope in Chef Bawmra Jap of the legendary Bomras in Goa to consult on the menu. The 'Bomras Tomato Salad', 'Pickled Tea Leaf Salad', 'Forrest Mushroom' and 'Shan Tofu' are some of their popular dishes.</p>
