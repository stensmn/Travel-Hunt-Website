        <p class="text-big">Mabruk</p>
        <p class="text-small">Other than kebabs and shawramas Middle Eastern cuisine is surprisingly lacking in popularity. It is a huge misconception that this glorious cuisine is all about these two dishes, however, it is much more. Few restaurants try to attempt exploring Middle Eastern fare transforming it into a more mainstream affair. One of those few is ‘Mabruk’, a gorgeous fine dining restaurant dedicated to discovering the delights of Middle Eastern food with finesse and love.</p>
